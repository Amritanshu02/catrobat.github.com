Make sure that your program contains only general information about yourself, for example (but not necessarily all of these) your hobbies, music or TV series you like, preferred school subjects, country, mother tongue, which games you like, your pets, your family and/or friends, or opinions you have about important or recent events. Include images or sound bytes that illustrate what your avatar on the screen is telling the user of your app. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Make especially very sure your program does not contain any personal information such as your real name, address, or photos of you, your family, or your friends, neither in the program itself, nor in the description or the name of your program. Upload your program to Catrobat&rsquo;s sharing platform. When you create an account on Catrobat&rsquo;s sharing site, please either use OAuth with your Google+ or Facebook account to login, or create a new Catrobat account. Do not use a username for your avatar that allows to identify or contact you, for instance do not use your real name, email address, your birthdate, or the name of an account that you have already used on the web and that would allow other people to identify you in the future (note that photos can also be used to identify persons using face recognition technology as included in popular services such as Facebook or Google Photos). Add an avatar image to your Catrobat account that similarly cannot be tracked to your real name. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">If you feel unsure whether you should include certain information, please talk to your parents or other persons which you trust. In case of doubt, do not include the information. After the acceptance of your task, you have the possibility to delete your program from Catrobat&rsquo;s sharing site by navigating to your &ldquo;My Profile&rdquo; page (tap on three dots at the top right on the page) and tap on the white disc with an &ldquo;x&rdquo; in it at the top right of the thumbnail of the project.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Your program should use English as its communication language with your user, e.g., in the text of the speech bubbles, but please do not worry if the grammar or pronunciation is not perfect &ndash; we will not consider these at all when evaluating your program. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Do not use any abbreviations in your program, and structure it clearly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Task tags: Visual programming; App creation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span>Level: </span><span class="c10">Beginner</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c7" id="h.o1s1o23w7j8l"><span class="c10">2: Showcase: educational Catrobat game</span></h2><p class="c5"><span>Create a single-level game with Pocket Code in one of the categories Adventure, Puzzle, Quiz, Action, Racing, </span><span>Shooter, </span><span class="c1">Simulation, RPG, or Strategy, that is related to a topic from your preferred school subject.

Use the scene bricks to structure in at least five scenes: Add</span><span>&nbsp;a n</span><span class="c1">ew intro scene where the objective of the game is explained, add a tutorial scene for the game, add a completely new &ldquo;boss&rdquo; level, and add an end scene to the game. The original game that you remix must be fairly challenging, but you may slightly enhance it if you want. The new, second level of the game must fit the same general theme but cannot be a simple variant of the existing level. Instead, the new level must be of a different genre of a game. The final scene must conclude the game, and allow to restart the game in case the player lost. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Example (this is just an example; chose a totally different game to remix and a different new level to add!): Robin was drunk and has been put into the dungeons by Nottingham&rsquo;s sheriff. Marian, Robin&rsquo;s girlfriend, after getting no responses from Robin to her increasingly urgent WhatsApp messages, becomes more and more worried about him. Finally she hears from </span><span>her </span><span>girlfriend</span><span>s</span><span>&nbsp;about his capture, whom </span><span>they </span><span>heard from their boyfriends who were out drinking with him in the tavern last night, before he started a fist fight with a group of other drunken ruffians. OMG! However, she loves him and decides to free him. First level: She has to navigate through a maze against the clock. The maze is filled with various delaying or even fatal traps, e.g., a pool party at her best friend&rsquo;s home, a 50%-off sales offer at a shoe shop that she cannot pass, an ice cream stand that delays her just for a few seconds, a cute cat on the way, etc. A second level could be that the sheriff is very angry about a mixup in the local arts museum. If Marian can help him match up the paintings with the descriptions, he will feel much better and most likely let Robin go out of prison early. The player is shown pictures and must match them with the names of their painters. The end scene could be either a happy end with Robin freed from prison and lots of kisses, or you crying in your girlfriend&rsquo;s arms and giving up on Robin. What a mess! It&rsquo;s his own fault, stupid drunkard!

Use data sources that are as recent as you can find. Where possible, differentiate between Android and iOS for the different regions (among teenagers!). If possible, differentiate between cities and rural areas. Make a sanity-check in your area to see if the numbers correspond. Extrapolate how many teenagers can be reached with Pocket Code on Android phones now, and in the near future on Android and iOS, versus how many can be reached when only traditional PCs or tablets can be used instead of phones. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Make a report including maps showing these numbers for different countries and/or regions of the world.
