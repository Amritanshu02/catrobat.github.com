       <h2>First steps and rules</h2>
         <p>First, let’s have a look at the <a href="https://share.catrob.at/pocketcode/pocket-library/looks">media library</a> in which we provided some awesome graphics for you.
           You can use them to make your program more colorful and they will give you some good ideas for your app.
           Of course you may use third-party graphics, but please respect copyrights and license requirements.</p>
         <p>After having a look at our media gallery you will need an idea. You will have to think about what kind of program (game, animation, etc.) you want to create,
           and try to relate it to the theme of Heroes of the Universe. You might even already have some great ideas after having a look at the media assets.
         </p>
           <p>In order to make your app even more interesting you can implement some of the following features (they are optional, and not all will fit to every program):
<br>
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A welcome screen
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A short description
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A "You have won!" screen
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A game-over screen
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; Sounds or music
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; Sensors
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A second level
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; Collisions
           <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9733; A foreign language
