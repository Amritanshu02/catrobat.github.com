	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<p>Version 2.2, 10 April 2018</p>
	<p>To offer you all the benefits of our services and the associated account, it is necessary to collect certain data from you.</p>
	  <ul>	  
		  <li>To maintain and improve our services (apps and websites) and to do scientific research on ICT and STEM/STEAM education, we use Google Analytics, Crashlytics, and Firebase, all by Google LLC (USA), to get metadata about the usage of our services (e.g., crash-information, timestamps, visited pages/screens, usage of our apps and servises, used operating system, and information about the network provider). This analysis and the collected data is not linked to your profile and does not contain any personal information (last bits of the IP address get anonymized). However, the collected data will get transferred to the service-provider (Google LLC, USA). Data processing is based on an agreement with Google LLC. This relationship to the service-provider pays respect to the EU-USA "Privacy Shield" agreement.</li>
		  
		  <li>To create and use an account in our systems, and to inform you about necessary changes about your account (e.g., updates or violation of our Use of Terms of Use and Service or of community rules) or our policies, we will store your username and, if provided by you, your e-mail address. If you have connected your account via Google Plus or Facebook, we additionally store an identification key connected to your account on these services. We will not use this data for any other (e.g., marketing) purposes, unless you explicitly allowed us to do so.</li>
		  
		  <li>On a voluntary basis, you can give us your country of residence through your account page on the sharing site. This will get displayed on your public profile and only be used for statistical and research purposes by us. It can be removed at any time in your profile settings.</li>
		   
		  <li>You can withdraw the usage of this personal data at any time by deleting your account through your profile page on https://share.catrob.at/. After deleting your account you will still be able to use the provided services, but not to collaborate, e.g., through uploading programs, commenting, or liking. Also all provided content linked to your account, e.g., uploaded programs, comments, etc., will be deleted.</li>
		  		  
		  <li>To avoid misuse of our services (e.g., through user contributed uploads or comments) for illegal purposes, all user generated public data (uploads, comments) will be stored internally in a database, together with a timestamp and the used IP address. This data will not be used by or forwarded to any institutions, unless sufficiently illegal actions are reasonably suspected and officially entitled legal institutions request it based on applicable law (each case will be thoroughly checked on an individual basis by us first).</li>
		  
		  <li>You can subscribe to the Catrobat Newsletter provided by us through the MailChimp service (The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a MailChimp, USA). You may voluntarily submit your e-mail address to MailChimp (USA) via the web-interface provided by MailChimp. We do not provide any mail-addresses from your account to this provider ourselves. You can withdraw the newsletter at any time by using the "unsubscribe" link within the newsletter. This newsletter is provided by MailChimp with whom we do have a data-processing agreement and who committed to the GDPR and EU-USA "Privacy Shield". For further details please look up MailChimp's Privacy Policy.</li>

		  <li>All Services are provided by the non-profit free open source Catrobat project under the umbrella of the International Catrobat Association – Verein zur Förderung freier Software (Graz, Austria).
		  To get in touch with us, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@catrobat.org">contact@catrobat.org</a> or mail us to Catrobat, c/o Institute of Software Technology, Inffeldgasse 16b/II, A-8010 Graz, Austria (Europe).</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>In case you are below the age of 14, this policy must be accepted by a legal guardian (usually a parent).</p>
