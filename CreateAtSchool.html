          <em>Create@School</em> is a visual programming language and a set of creativity tools.
        </p>
	
       <p>
	All features and extensions of our Create@School app  have been integrated into our free <a href="https://catrob.at/pc">Pocket Code</a> app.

        <p>
	The Create@School app has been developed by the Catrobat team together with the "No One Left Behind" consortium. The No One Left Behind project, co-funded by the EU Horizon 2020  Innovation Action (Grant Agreement No. 645215), aimed at allowing children to use a non-leisure gaming toolkit to develop digital games on mobile devices with the aim of enhancing their abilities across all academic subjects, as well as their logical reasinong, creativity and social skills.

        <p>
          Catrobat and the software developed by the Catrobat team are 
          inspired by the Scratch programming system 
          developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. 
	  
	Catrobat itself is an independent free/libre open source software (FOSS/FLOSS) non-profit project.
