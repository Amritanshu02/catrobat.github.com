        <h2>First steps into Catrobat</h2><br />
        <strong>Hi, <br />the following lines should help you with your first steps into the Catrobat Project.</strong>
          <br />24 February 2013</p>

          <p>Assuming you already know developer.catrobat.org your next steps should be:

            <ol>
              <li> Visit us on <a href="https://github.com/Catrobat">GitHub</a> <br />
                As you can see Catrobat is a very large project with a lot of sub-teams. So go ahead and look into them. Each project should have a readme file so check that out too. There should be viable information for you in it.</li>
              <li> If you want more information, visit us our <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/116816272940643231129">Google+ Community named Catrobat</a>. If you would like to work with us, please read on.</li>
              <li> If you want to contribute to our project, please choose one of the sub-projects, you would like to work on. Once you have chosen a project, we recommend that you checkout the project and play around with it a little.</li>
              <li> Maybe you find a bug while trying out Catrobat? Awesome. Report it via GitHub. If you can’t find a bug, doesn’t matter; seems that we have done too much the right way ;)</li>
              <li> Now is the right time to check out the Issues on GitHub. First fork the project then choose an Issue you can fix -->fix it and write a test for it.</li>
              <li> You have fixed an Issue and written at least one test for it? Awesome. Ask for a review via a Pull-Request in Github.</li>
              <li> It could take time some time until you hear from us.... In the meanwhile why not choose another Issue or engage in the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/116816272940643231129"> community on Google+</a>. Try to answer questions of visitors or pose questions yourself, if you have still have some.</li>
              <li> Your Pull-Request has been accepted? Go back to 5.</li>
              <li> There are no more Issues? Can’t be! Go back to 4.</li>

            </ol>

          </p>
