                  <li>These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Service, including users who are also contributors of Content on the Service. "Content" includes the text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service. The Service includes all aspects of Catrobat, including but not limited to all products, software, and services offered via Catrobat's websites.</li>
                  <li>The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by the Catrobat team (in the following also called "Catrobat"). Catrobat has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Catrobat will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve Catrobat from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.</li>
                  <li>Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>3. Catrobat Accounts</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>In order to access some features of the Service, you will have to create a Catrobat account. You may never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure.</li>
                  <li>Although Catrobat will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Catrobat or others due to such unauthorized use.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>4. General Use of the Service-Permissions and Restrictions</h3>
                <p>Catrobat hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service as set forth in these Terms of Service, provided that:</p>
                <ol type="a">

                  <li>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Catrobat servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Catrobat grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Catrobat reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.

However, by submitting Content to Catrobat, you hereby put this Content under the licenses detailed on <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/licenses_of_uploaded_catrobat_programs">http://developer.catrobat.org/licenses_of_uploaded_catrobat_programs</a>, thereby granting Catrobat and each user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and Catrobat's (and its successors' and affiliates') activities, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.

                  <li>Catrobat will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</li>
                  <li>Catrobat reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive size.

                  <li>
                    If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Directive 2001/29/EC and other applicable intellectual property laws by contacting us via email with the following information in writing:

                      <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</li>

                      <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
                      <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
                    </ol>
                    You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your notice may not be valid.
		</li>
                  <li>
                    Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to us via email:
                    <ol type="i">
                      <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
                      <li>Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
                      <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content; and</li>
                      <li>Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Graz, Austria, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
                    </ol>
                    If a counter-notice is received by us, Catrobat may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Catrobat's sole discretion.

                <p>The Service is controlled and offered by Catrobat from its facilities in Austria.

                <p>You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. If you are under 13 years of age, then please talk to your parents about whether this site is appropriate for you.</p>
                <h3>13. General</h3>
                <p>You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in Austria; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Catrobat, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Austria. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of Austria, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Catrobat that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Graz, Austria. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Notice at <a href="http://developer.catrobat.org/privacy_policy">http://developer.catrobat.org/privacy_policy</a> and any other legal notices published by Catrobat on the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Catrobat concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Catrobat's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Catrobat reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.</p>
                <p>YOU AND CATROBAT AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
