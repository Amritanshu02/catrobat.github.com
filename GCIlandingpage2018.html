			<p>If you are between 13 and 17 years old, interested in creating awesome games and apps with Pocket Code to get a chance at winning a trip to Google headquarters in California join the Google Code-in at <b><a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">codein.withgoogle.com</a></b>. The contest will last from <b>October 18th until December 13th, 2018</b>.</p>
			<p>By completing a wide array of tasks during the contest you can show your skills with coding and your knowledge with open source software and have a chance at winning tons of goodies from Google and Catrobat, the grand prize being an invitation to the Google headquarters in California together with one of your parents next summer! </p> 
			<p>We are encouraging teenagers from all areas of the world, speaking any languages, both girls and boys, to take their first steps in coding and open source projects with us. We offer a variety of tasks, so even if you have no knowledge of programming at all, feel free to participate and help in other fields of open source software, such as design or documentation! Our mentors will be available to help you with your tasks and will try to answer to your questions as fast as they can. </p>
			<p>Don't hesitate, coding can be as simple (and complex!) as cooking.</p>
