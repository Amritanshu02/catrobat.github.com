			<h2>Project proposal for Google Season of Docs 2021</h2>
			<br />
			<strong>Welcome,
				<br />
				we officially present our project idea for this year's Google Season of Docs.</strong>
			<br />
			Last Updated: 11 March 2021</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>About Catrobat</u></strong>
				<br />
				Catrobat (first released in 2010 as Catroid, now Pocket Code) aims to provide teenagers and adults a
				solution to learn coding, to be creative and be prepared for the digital future of our world, as simple
				logical processes, creative solutions and easily understandable connections are essential in the world
				of tomorrow.
				<br />
				Our vision is to provide young people with the chance to include these principles in their
				everyday digital-life. We believe that free, age-based and motivating software, which can be used
				directly by teenagers or in education, is essential in order to prepare the next generation for their
				future.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>The project</u></strong>
				<br />
				The goal of this project is to update a part of the educational resources provided on the <a
					href="http://wiki.catrobat.org">Catrobat Wiki</a>. The main goal of the project is to update the
				Wikis educational documentation, to increase the educational value of the content and make it more
				accessible for a wide audience (from kids to young adults).
				<br />
				The documentation should provide introductions into basic and advanced programming concepts. Through
				updating the documentation, we want
				to give the users, as well as the creators, a well structured basis & overview for a well documented
				educational wiki page.
				<br />
				Therefore the main focus of the project will be to update the Wikis how-tos
				section. The project should also focus on other essential parts (e.g. tutorials, FAQ, etc.) to not only
				increase the educational value, but also the user and creator friendliness.
			</p>

			<hr />

			<p>
			<h3>Scope</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Examine the the existing state of the documentation based on these factors
					<ul>
						<li>
							Educational quality
						</li>
						<li>
							User Friendliness
						</li>
						<li>
							Structure
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Evaluate the missing programming concepts
				</li>
				<li>
					Update / Create the educational material
				</li>
				<li>
					Incorporate feedback
				</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The project is estimated to need between 4 - 6 months, with a work load of 6hr/week, depending on the
				current state of the documentation. For this task it would be ideal if the technical writer has a
				background in education to create the resources.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><u>Measuring the project success</u></strong>
				<br />
				The current state of the documentation provides little educational value and is hard to navigate for the
				users. After updating the documentation the educational value of the documentation will increase and it
				should be easier to navigate through the educational resources. Through updating the structure of the
				page and the how-tos section we will provide the users with a place where they can easily find the
				needed information for simple tasks as well as more complex problems.
				<br />
				We consider this project to be a
				success if we evaluate the usability and educational value, measured through surveys, of the to have
				increased. The many possibilities and the already existing content will boost the process of the
				project. Through a technical writer, the how-tos, among others, can be prepared in a meaningful way,
				especially for the young adults. A simple navigation, as well as educational materials, form the
				foundation for using the visual programming language Catrobat in a playful and easy way.
			</p>

				<strong><u>Additional information</u></strong>
				<br />
				Catrobat regularly participates in the Google Summer of Code and this is our first participation in the
				Google Season of Docs.
				<br />
				Within the framework of this project, it would finally be possible to provide a wide range of
				documentation. This first experience with a technical writer can be a basis for our how-tos. This being
				our first time working with a technical writer, we will make sure to provide optimal support and
				integration into the Catrobat workflow.
